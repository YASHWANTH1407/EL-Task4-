🔍 Binary Classification with Logistic Regression
🧠 Objective
Build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict outcomes from structured data (e.g., disease prediction using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset).

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Workflow
1. Dataset
Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from Scikit-learn (or Kaggle).

2. Preprocessing
Checked for missing values and data types

Standardized features using StandardScaler

Performed train-test split with stratification

3. Model Building
Used LogisticRegression from scikit-learn

Trained model on training data

Evaluated with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC

4. Visualization & Insights
Plotted confusion matrix

Visualized ROC curve

Explained Sigmoid Function used in classification

Tuned decision threshold for business-specific needs

📦 Output
Binary classifier model file (optional .pkl)

Metrics report

Visual plots for analysis

🚀 Future Work
Try regularization (L1, L2)

Handle imbalanced datasets

Use cross-validation for better generalization
